## About
Celestial Strands brings content from the original Escape Velocity series, primarily Escape Velocity: Override, to Endless Sky in a new playable area. The plug-in focuses on the various factions of the Crescent, including the Strands, Zachit, and Miranu, and their presence in a new, young galaxy. Will the Strands reunite once more under the same banner, or will inner turmoil be their undoing yet again?

Current additions:
* A new galactic area to explore containing a total of 110 new systems and 92 new planets.
* Seven new governments based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.
* 24 new ships based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.
* 36 new outfits based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.

## Content Access
You can access the new content either through creating new pilot and selecting the "Crescent Strands" option, or through the Hariza system located near The Rim by Jumpdrive. Reccommend also using Omnis: https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/-Omnis

## Known Issues
The `system` Za Helis has issues with ships not hyperspacing correctly and clumping up over time.

## Limitations
Currently, there is only the galaxy map, ships, outfits, and governments to play with. There is no story content as of yet.
Balancing is still in need of fine-tuning, however it has been done using EV:Override's data within Endless Sky's environment.
Planets do not have proper landscapes, descriptions, outfitter, or shipyard setups yet, and will be expanded upon in the future.
Fleets and Governments are skeletal and simple at the moment, and will be expanded upon in the future.
Currently, HighDPI is within the original graphic folders, but will be separated later on if necessary.
